#+Description: My cross-format résumé

Welcome to my resume/CV repository.

Through the use Org mode and its ability to export to many formats,
I offer several ways to view this document:
- Printer-friendly [[https://github.com/armkeh/resume/raw/master/main.pdf][PDF]].
- Screen-friendly [[https://armkeh.github.io/resume][HTML]].
- Rendered markdown on [[https://github.com/armkeh/resume/blob/master/main.md][Github]].
- Rendered Org code on [[https://github.com/armkeh/resume/blob/master/main.md][Github]].
  - The raw Org code contains source code which is hidden in the produced documents,
    along with documentation on how the styling of the documents is produced.
